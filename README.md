# Machine Learning models to predict heart disease

A python program which used data analysis techniques to observe trends between various risk factors for heart diseases. Then, machine leaning models were created to predict whether a person has heart disease based on those features.

## Required packages
1. Requires ```Python 3.7``` or above.
2. Requires these modules:
    - NumPy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - joblib
## Running the program
1. Download the whole repository
2. extract the code
3. open ```heart_CAD.py``` and press enter to run the program

##### Note: I used Spyder IDE along with anaconda throughout this project (on Windows 10) 

## Models used:
1. [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
2. [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
3. [K-nearest neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
